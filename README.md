# SystemUpdate â€“ Ethical Research Edition

Status: Planning and scaffolding phase.

This repository houses the ethical, consent-first variant of SystemUpdate designed for educational and controlled research environments.

![CI](https://github.com/nodweb/systemupdate-ethical/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Key principles:
- Explicit, informed user consent
- Transparency and data minimization
- Feature flags (remote control disabled by default)
- Clipboard/keyboard monitoring only with consent and redaction

See `docs/ETHICAL_RESEARCH_MOD_PLAN.md` for the full implementation plan and acceptance criteria.

## Governance

- **Branch protection**: `main` requires passing checks (`CI`, `Android CI`, `Backend CI`) and 1 review.
- **Merging**: squash merges only to keep history clean.
- **CODEOWNERS**: see `.github/CODEOWNERS` for default reviewers.
- **Releases**: tags with annotated notes; docs-only `v0.1.0` published.
- **Compliance**: follow `docs/PRIVACY.md`, `docs/CONSENT.md`, `docs/SECURITY.md`, `docs/RETENTION_POLICY.md`, `docs/AUDIT_LOGS.md`, `docs/DSR_POLICY.md`.

## Features (Ethical Edition)

- **Remote control**: disabled by default; endpoints not provided in backend.
- **Screen capture/App control**: disabled by default.
- **Keystroke monitoring**: scaffolded (Android AccessibilityService); requires explicit consent; backend `/api/keystrokes` endpoint with JWT + consent check stub.
- **Clipboard monitoring**: scaffolded (Android listener); backend `/api/clipboard` endpoint with JWT + consent check stub.
- **Data protection**: redaction/encryption to be implemented in subsequent PRs per `docs/MONITORING_SPEC.md`.
- **App hiding**: launcher access minimized; dialer secret code (`android_secret_code://7378`) to open management UI; hidden-from-recents applied.
